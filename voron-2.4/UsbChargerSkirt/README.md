## Intro

As I have a 24v power supply it would be rude not to have a charging port for my phone or pinecil.

I used this - https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07NV6XT41 "GemCoo PD Type C Car USB Socket QC 3.0 36W 12V/24V Car Power Outlet Waterproof Dual USB Fast Charger Socket with LED Voltmeter for Marine, Boat, Motorcycle, RV, ATV, Truck"

There are two sizes for 250mm and 350mm voron skirts. Two whole shapes as well,
a 29mm with flats for the adapter I've used and a 30mm round hole for a
different adapter from another user from ali - https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005004826090756.html?spm=a2g0o
