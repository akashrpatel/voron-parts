Using the [Klicky Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe) mount 
as the upper support for the z chain making use of the smaller chain from
the x or y gantry.

Now a "NoMount" option if you don't use
klicky e.g. [Voron TAP](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap)

Finally added an IGUS set which may also work.

- X or Y gantry chain
- M5 roll-in and bolt
- M3 roll-in and bolt
